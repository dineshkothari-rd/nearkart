# Decisions, assumptions, and risks

## Accepted decisions

| ID | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| D-001 | Modular monolith | Fastest reliable delivery with enforceable boundaries |
| D-002 | Java 17 + Spring Boot 4.1.x | Compatible with detected LTS JDK; stable supported baseline |
| D-003 | PostgreSQL + Flyway | Relational integrity, migrations, strong search baseline |
| D-004 | Haversine after bounding-box prefilter | Sufficient MVP geography without PostGIS operations cost |
| D-005 | PostgreSQL trigram search behind `SearchService` | Handles partial/case-insensitive MVP queries without a search cluster |
| D-006 | JWT access + rotating opaque refresh token | Stateless API access with practical revocation |
| D-007 | Soft lifecycle state for core entities | Preserves referential/audit history |
| D-008 | Current price plus append-only history | Fast reads with traceable price changes |
| D-009 | URL/context before Zustand | Avoids duplicate client state |

## Assumptions

- Initial market uses INR and Indian addresses; schema retains currency and timezone.
- Search radius is capped at 25 km and results at 100/page.
- Store owners manually maintain inventory in MVP.
- A user may own multiple stores; a store has one primary owner initially.
- Reviews establish account/store interaction only through platform rules; verified purchase is unavailable because purchases happen offline.
- Public SEO requirements will be reassessed before Phase 6 because a Vite SPA alone cannot guarantee rich indexing.

## Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation / trigger |
|---|---|
| Manual inventory becomes stale | Prominent freshness, lower rank, reports, owner reminders later |
| Duplicate catalog data | Admin-owned canonical variants, aliases, uniqueness, moderation |
| Location query slows | Bounding box/index/query-plan checks; adopt PostGIS when measured |
| Trigram relevance is weak | Query telemetry and aliases; add dedicated search only after evidence |
| Ranking biases price/distance | Explain factors, test scenarios, version/measure weight changes |
| Owner cross-tenant access | Service-level ownership checks and negative integration tests |
| Refresh token theft/replay | Hash, rotate, family reuse detection, secure cookie |
| Review abuse without purchase proof | One/user/store, throttling, moderation, account status |
| SPA SEO underperforms | Measure indexing; add prerendering/SSR only for public pages if needed |
| Analytics tables grow quickly | Minimal events, retention/aggregation plan before high volume |

## Deferred deliberately

Redis, PostGIS, OpenSearch, Kafka, microservices, delivery/payment flows, multi-product optimization, alerts, promotion, subscriptions, POS/CSV import, PWA, and full i18n. Add each only when its documented trigger appears.
